A simple _codelogs_ manager.

## Stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## What Codelogs is?

_Codelogs_ is a simple web application to manage code logs. It was written using `React` , `TypeScript` and `Material-UI`.

To keep things simple, The codelogs are stored locally, in the browser, using the 'localStorage` API.

Things I plan to do implement the future:

- Dark/light mode (maybe theme)
- option to export the codelogs to a file
- option to sync with services like Dropbox, Google Drive,...
- an easy way to delete all codelogs
- search codelogs
- improve tests
- improve accessibility
